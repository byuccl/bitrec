# BRAM_L Differences
The numbers listed below are line numbers in the db.INT_L.json file that was generated using the most recent code.  

The term 'new' below refers to the most recent codeâ€“generated database. The word 'old' below refers to what was in the bitrec/byu_db folder.

## "0" - RAMBFIFO36E1
- Lots of diffs that can't be attributed to ordering or something else  
  
### Examnple From RAMBFIFO36E1
- ALMOST_EMPTY_OFFSET
  - From [0] through [12] only two values solved for (others unsolved)
  - [11] not solved for in old but solved for in new
  - [12] only half of the 16 bits are the same between old and new
- Similar for ALMOST_FULL_OFFSET
- DATA_WIDTH has 7800 lines for its values and little in common between old and new

- As a result of a few spotchecks, I did not spend a whole lot of time on this one, I focused more on the ones below for starters.

## "1"
- Starts at 197440

### SITE TYPE FIFO18E1, BEL FIFO18E1
- Starts at 197444
- Lots of diffs that can't be attributed to ordering or something else.  These include the following:
  - TYPE 1 Differences
    - Bits in new are a subset of old - did the analysis simply get better?  (197553 is an example)
  - TYPE 2 Differences
    - Some features solved for in old are missing in new - is it the luck of the random draw?  (197634 is an example)
  - TYPE 3 Differences
    - The bits are just different with no apparent pattern (197692 is an example)

### SITE TYPE RAMB18E1, BEL RAMB18E1
- Starts at 200312
- 293425
  - The start of differences.  These look to be simply due to ordering (of disjunctions in conjunction)
    - After taking these into account, everything matches up

## "2"
- Starts at 293724

### SITE TYPE FIFO18E1, BEL FIFO18E1
- 293727
  - There was no FIFO18E1 section in the old one but there is in the new one!!

### SITE TYPE RAMB18E1, BEL RAMB18E1
- Starts at 294137
- 387276
  - Other than 3 diffs due to ordering (of disjunctions in conjunction), everything matches up.

## TILE_PIPS
- Starts at 387551
  - New pip structure looks different:

NEW =
"BRAM_RAMB18_DOPBDOP0->BRAM_LOGIC_OUTS_B3_3": {
      "BITS": [],
      "TYPE": "PIP"
    },

OLD =
"BRAM_ADDRARDADDRL0->>BRAM_FIFO18_ADDRATIEHIGH0": [
  []
],

- I did not compare the tile pip bits between old and new
